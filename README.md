# Course Management Sytem
This system manages courses using Angular for a dynamic frontend, Express.js for backend logic, MongoDB for flexible data storage, and Multer for image uploads. Users can add, edit, update, and remove courses through a user-friendly interface. The backend handles data validation, interacts with the database, and processes image uploads. This architecture provides a scalable and maintainable solution for managing course information effectively.
